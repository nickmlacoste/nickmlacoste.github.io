[Machine Learning Econometrics](https://tulane.instructure.com/courses/2291861) is a course I designed aimed towards experienced undergraduates and Master's students. The course focuses on machine learning methods that economics students should know about if they wish to pursue careers in data science or analytics. The average economics curriculum (both undergraduate and graduate) typically does not expose students to the majority of these methods. Yet, in both industry and (increasingly) economic research, prediction problems are pervasive. I designed this course to address this knowledge gap.
