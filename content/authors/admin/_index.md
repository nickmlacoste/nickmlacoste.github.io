#    summary: |
#      I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

## About Me

Welcome to my website! I am a Ph.D. candidate in economics at Tulane University, with expected completion in 2026. Broadly, my research focuses on the intersection of microeconomic theory and machine learning/non-parametric econometrics. My agenda focuses on optimizing public policy and business decision making by synthesising modern social welfare theory, causal inference, and the predictive capabilities of machine learning. I currently work in the fields of optimal taxation and optimal government expenditure policies in both developed and developing economies.
